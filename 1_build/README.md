# Build

This folder builds the heterogenous time-resolved knowledge graph from the downloaded content in `../0_prepare`. Please run the scripts there before running these. The scripts are based on notebooks generated by Mayers et al., as seen [here](https://github.com/mmayers12/semmed/tree/master/build).

## To run

Run the `./building.py` script with appropriate flags.
```bash
# non-interactive
mamba run -n mini_semmed --no-capture-output python building.py 

# ... or : 
python building.py -v [semmed version] \
    -d [drugcentral-date] \
    -y [hyperparameter optimization year] \
    --split_hyperparameter_optimization \
    --include_time \
    --split_train_test_valid \
    --drop_negative_relations \
    --convert_negative_relations 
```
